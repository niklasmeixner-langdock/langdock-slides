# /slides - Generate Slides from Templates

Generate presentation slides by selecting and filling existing templates. This is the primary workflow for creating slide decks.

## When to Use
- Creating multiple slides from a training schedule or topic list
- Standard slide types (agenda, features, comparisons, etc.)
- Quick turnaround with consistent quality

## Workflow

1. **Parse the request** - Identify topics/modules to cover
2. **Research content** - Read `knowledge/index.md`, fetch docs if needed
3. **Select templates** - Match content to appropriate template
4. **Generate HTML** - Fill template with content, save to `slides/<client>/`
5. **Import to Figma** - Use Playwright capture workflow (see CLAUDE.md)

## Template Catalog

Browse `templates/` for available layouts. Each template is self-documented with comments.

## Template Workflow

For each slide:

```
1. Read the template HTML file
2. Understand its structure (comments explain customization points)
3. Replace placeholder content with actual content
4. Adjust number of items/cards as needed
5. Save to slides/<client>/slide-name.html
```

### Example

User: "Create a slide about Langdock integrations"

```
1. Check templates → 11-platform-overview.html or 13-network-connection.html
2. Read template to understand structure
3. Research: Read knowledge/index.md → fetch integrations docs
4. Fill template with integration names, icons, descriptions
5. Save to slides/client/integrations.html
6. Capture to Figma
```

## Multi-slide Sessions

When creating multiple slides:

1. **Start server once**: `npx http-server . -p 8080 &`
2. **Ask Figma destination once**: Let user pick file
3. **Create all slides**: Write HTML files
4. **Batch capture**: Generate capture IDs, run Playwright for each
5. **Cleanup**: Close browser when done

## Tips

- **Don't over-customize** - Templates are designed to work; just fill content
- **One concept per slide** - Split dense topics across multiple slides
- **Use the right template** - If content doesn't fit, pick a different template or use `/design-slide`
- **Check icons** - Use `assets/tabler-icons/` for consistent iconography
